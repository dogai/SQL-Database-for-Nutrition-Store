This project was developed as part of a college assignment and focuses on creating two main queries within the context of a Nutrition Store example.

The queries are as follows:
  1) Identify the best-selling imported creatine brand and the best-selling domestically produced whey powder brand between 2015 and 2020, along with their respective total incomes.
  2) Determine the ratio of females to males among users who have ordered L-karnitin at least 5 times in the last 5 years.

In addition to the SQL query codes, the project includes:
  - Java application code
  - UML class diagram
  - Flowchart
  - Explanation of the project's main idea
